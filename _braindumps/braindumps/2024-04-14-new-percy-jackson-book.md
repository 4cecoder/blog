Hey everyone, as you all already know that I am a massive fan of the Percy Jackson books. I am writing this post to discuss what we know till now about the new upcoming Percy Jackson and the Wrath of the Triple Goddess book in September of 2024.

Well back when Percy Jackson and the Chalice of the Gods came out, I thought that Percy would finish all those quest in that book itself but as a surprise he only completed one of them. Well I dont complain it as I always need more of Percy Jackson, so much that I have read it a millionth time now. Yeah I need some new books outside of the Riordan-verse. Well this post is not about me and my addiction of Percy Jackson, its about the new book. So shall we begin?

## What We Know So Far:

- Picking up after the events of the Chalice of the Gods, mah boy Percy is still on the hunt for those college recommendation letters. My boy just cant have rest i guess.

- This time he would be helping Hecate, The goddess of magic, crossroads, and..... well, cats. Apparently this time my boy needs tohousesit Hecate's interesting pets. Given his track records, things are bound to get messy.

- So apparently Grover messes things up, ofcourse its Grover. The G-man is going to become a giant goat and Hecate's pets are going to be loose on the New York City. Our trio would have only days to find Hecate's pets and restore her mansion back to order or face the full fury of Hecate and her horrifying three heads. It would take luck, and some old and new friends to hunt down the animals and set things right again.

It says some old and new friends. Honestly I want to see Nico and Will helping them and I guess they will make some new friends too, lets see if I am right about this (fingers crossed). We might get Thalia with the other hunters instead of Nico and Will, well it would work too for me as I always saw Thalia and Percy like siblings.

## Below is the British cover of the Wrath of the Triple Goddess:
