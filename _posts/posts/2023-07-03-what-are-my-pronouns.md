<summary>Philosophy answer</summary>

Third-person pronouns, such as he, him, she, her, it, they, are used by a person that isn't me in order to refer to me without having to say my full name each time.


I don't say my own pronouns, because I am me.


Therefore my pronouns are whatever other people say I am.

I'm not picky. Since i'm a man choosing manly pronouns would make sense... but ultimately my pronouns really are what other people say they are.
