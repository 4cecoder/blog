With the support of two major anti-cheat systems, BattleEye and Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC), actively backing Linux gaming for the past couple of years, and the recent release of the [Steam Deck](https://steamdeck.com), coupled with Proton's continuous improvements, Linux gaming has seen significant progress. For the most part, I no longer worry about checking if a game supports Linux or not; I simply purchase the game, and it usually "just works," with only a few exceptions.

I believed we were heading towards a promising future for Linux gaming. However, some companies, despite their games being compatible with Linux, choose not to enable BattleEye or EAC support for Linux. Examples include Destiny 2, PUBG, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, Fortnite (from EAC developers), and games like Valorant with Riot Games' rootkit.

But there's another player in the game: EA. Last year, they introduced a deep dive into their new anti-cheat system, known as EA Anti-Cheat or EA C. don't get confused with EAC (Easy AntiCheat) which functions on Linux, which is a rootkit. Well it works under linux but it operates in user mode, lacking many of the protections found in kernel mode, making it susceptible to cheats designed for Linux. This distinction is significant because, unless you're playing a Valve game utilizing VAC or a game like FF14 that has no anti-cheat, you're likely to install a rootkit – a reality of modern gaming.

In fact, we're no longer pretending that these anti-cheat systems aren't rootkits. Even FIFA 23, which launched with EA C, has a peculiar anti-cheat error that Windows gamers are also complaining about. EAC and BattleEye have benefited from many years of development, and introducing something new often means encountering bugs that other solutions have long resolved. I wish EA the best of luck in addressing these issues and achieving stability.

Until the 2023 release, FIFA worked well on Linux (FIFA 21 had a "Silver" rating, FIFA 22 had a "Gold" rating on [ProtonDB](https://protondb.com)), but issues emerged with FIFA 23. If EA invests heavily in this anti-cheat and deems it successful, they may adopt it across their extensive game library. EA, though massive, is still a single company. My concern is whether they'll set a trend for others to follow.

Riot's Vanguard rootkit and Epic's EAC are already in use, but EAC supports Linux. I can envision Activision and Ubisoft developing their in-house anti-cheat systems for the same reasons EA cites: increased control and the ability to implement privacy controls and customizations. Notably, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, despite having a Linux-compatible system, doesn't enable Linux support.

While single-player games with anti-cheat systems are rare, the possibility exists, as seen with Watch Dogs 2. I don't anticipate EA C disappearing, so if you plan to purchase an EA game, especially a multiplayer one, keep in mind that Linux support may break in the future due to an incompatible anti-cheat system.

EA could potentially make EA C work on Linux, but the question is whether the Linux market is significant enough to warrant the effort. Despite the Steam Deck's potential impact, Linux remains a relatively small market. Perhaps one day, improvements in Wine will eliminate this issue, making games seamlessly compatible with both Windows and Linux. But for now, exercise caution with your purchases, or explore indie games, where you're more likely to find fun and creative titles that work smoothly on Linux – sometimes even developed by teams who actively use Linux themselves. You never know what you might discover.
