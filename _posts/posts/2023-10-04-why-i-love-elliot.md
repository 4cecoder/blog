I really admire Elliot from "Mr. Robot." He's a complex character, and I want to share why I love him.

**Few words on him:**

Elliot has some psychological issues, but he's different from most people. He thinks the world needs saving from hidden, powerful forces that control us and make life worse. This might be hard for some to understand, but those who know about hacker culture or support certain ideas might relate.

To save the world, Elliot creates "fsociety" and does his best to make a change.

**What I loved the most:**

One important thing to learn from Elliot is how he doesn't judge people based on religion, race, or other things that divide us. He believes that a person's individual goodness matters more than these differences. Elliot never hated people just because they disagreed with him.

For example, there's a character named Gideon who is gay. Elliot doesn't care about that at all. He sees Gideon as a good person, even though Gideon might be doing some things that aren't great without realizing it. Elliot doesn't let differences like this make him hate people.

**In fsociety:**

Elliot's attitude extends to his group, fsociety. He cares about people like Trenton, who is Muslim, and Romero, who is black. He felt sad about what happened to them when the world was being unfair to them.

Elliot also becomes friends with Shayla, who's poor and involved with drugs. He doesn't care about society's judgments or social status.

**In last:**

To sum it up, I'm not saying Elliot loved everyone, but he saw the goodness in people and didn't let differences divide him. He only hated the systems and evil in the world, not the people he didn't know personally. This is an important lesson we can all learn from Elliot.
