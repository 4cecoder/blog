If you're a gamer, you might not be aware of the recent change that Unity, a popular game development engine, has made. It's a change that's causing quite a stir among game developers and is leaving many frustrated. In this blog post, we'll dive into Unity's new policy of charging developers $0.20 per install of their game, regardless of whether the game is paid or free. But what's even more concerning is how this policy handles repeated installations.

## The $0.20 Install Fee

Unity, known for its game development engine used by countless developers worldwide, has introduced a new fee structure that has left many in the industry scratching their heads. Now, for every installation of a game created using Unity, developers are charged $0.20. This applies to both free and paid games, which has raised eyebrows in the gaming community.

On the surface, this might not seem like a significant cost, but when you consider that many games have thousands or even millions of installs, it can quickly add up. For indie developers and small studios with tight budgets, this fee could cut into their already limited resources.

## Double-Counting Installs

The most frustrating part of Unity's new policy is how it handles repeated installations. If a player installs a game and then uninstalls it, only to reinstall it later, Unity counts this as two separate installs. This has opened the door to exploitation by some frustrated gamers who use scripts to repeatedly install and uninstall games. It's a loophole that can lead to disastrous financial consequences for developers.

Imagine a scenario where a small indie developer releases a free game, and it gains popularity, garnering thousands of installs. Then, a group of gamers decides to use scripts to uninstall and reinstall the game multiple times. Suddenly, what seemed like a successful launch turns into a financial nightmare as the developer faces an unexpected bill from Unity.

## The Impact on Developers

Unity's new policy has left developers in a difficult position. They must now weigh the benefits of using Unity against the potential financial burden of the $0.20 install fee. For many, this change feels unfair, as it doesn't take into account the legitimate reasons for reinstalling a game, such as troubleshooting issues or switching devices.

Furthermore, this policy may deter developers from offering free games, as they can't predict how many times a single user might uninstall and reinstall their game. It's a discouraging thought for those who rely on free games to build their brand and gain a following.

## Conclusion

Unity's decision to charge developers $0.20 per install, with the double-counting of installs, is undoubtedly causing frustration and concern in the gaming industry. While Unity is a powerful game development tool, this new policy may lead some developers to explore alternative engines or rethink their monetization strategies.

As gamers, we should be aware of the challenges that developers face and support fair policies that allow them to thrive. Unity's install fee is a topic worth discussing and monitoring as it continues to evolve in the world of game development.
