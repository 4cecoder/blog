Hey there fellow readers, So today I decided to share my custom GIMP brushes with you all. My brush has nature brushes.

As a GIMP devotee, I've always been captivated by the program's potential for customization. But creating your own brushes takes things to a whole new level. It allows you to add unique textures and effects to your artwork.

The following are the list of brushes I have made and is willing to share with you guys:

- Pine Tree: it has three brush sets, Normal, Skinny and Small.
- Grass: it has four sets, Grass Detailed, Grass Detailed 2, Grass Block and Grass subtle highlight.
- Fluff: Just a fluffy brush
- Flower: Just one brush which is a flower
- Weed: Yep, wild weed brush
