* The Problem
I connected a IQOO 9T (with USB debugging and File Transfer enabled) to my Arch Linux computer, however, it was not being detected by =lsblk=, =mtp= (through the =pcmanfm= integration), etc. However, it was being detected by =dmesg= and =lsusb=.

* The Solution
After some fiddling, it turned out that the problem (apparently) was that my computer hadnâ€™t been authorised by the phone.

I ran =adb shell=, causing an authorization popup in the phone. After authorizing the computer, it was able to detect the phone through =lsblk= and mount it through =aft-mtp-mount= etc.

#+begin_src sh
  sudo pacman -S android-file-transfer
  aft-mtp-mount /wherever/you/like/to/mount
#+end_src
