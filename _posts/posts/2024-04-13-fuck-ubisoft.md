Hello my fellow readers, so recently ubisoft had removed The Crew from all player's libraries. They have made it so difficult to own the game we purchased.

So for whoever who doesn't know what The Crew is then here you go, Its an online MMO driving game. Gamers should own the games they buy but this shit hole of a company called Ubisoft is making it so impossible to play The Crew even though people purchased it.

Ubisoft has prevented access to the game files and when you try to open it in the launcher (Ubisoft Connect) then a message like this appears "This game has been removed, try visiting the store to find a new game" like duh you are removing the games we bought from our libraries and want us to buy another game from you? You didnt even refund us for that game you took away.

Though I am not surprised by Ubisoft, they are pretty well known for the things like this. They would rather consider selling new games than preserving old ones. There are some dumbfucks who responded by buying Ubisoft's new games which is what Ubisoft wants.

Game preservation is important, it gives us gamers an option to play our favourite old games whenever we want. You know there is this thing called private servers which allows us to still enjoy older games when their official servers are shut down? Well let me give you an example, These games called Destiny 1 and Need for Speed has their private servers which still kept these games alive and there is still a BUNCH of people who play them and enjoy it.

Ubisoft could have just allowed private servers for The Crew but didn't and essentially made the game lost media.

Ubisoft these days care more about their pricing model, look at their new game Star Wars Outlaws. You have to pay fucking 9,000 INR or 99.62 EUR for it just for pre order with some extra added "bonus".

Ubisoft is more interested in getting people to subscribe to their service rather than letting us own the games. At this point i am scared that Ubisoft will destroy some of my favourite franchises by turning them into "life service slop experiences".
